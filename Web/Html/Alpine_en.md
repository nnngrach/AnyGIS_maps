It's no secret that the basic set of cards with which the application is supplied is often not enough. However, it is possible to add additional maps yourself. Here you will find two sets of [raster][07] online-maps:

### Basic set
A great option for beginners. If you still not sure what cards you should upload in the navigation app, you'll start with this collection. Here is a minimum set of the most necessary, in my opinion, cards.  This set is suitable not only to get acquainted with the different types of maps that can be installed in the application, but also quite cope with most everyday tasks.

### Full set
If you already know what kind of maps you need, then this set is for you. Note that it already includes maps from other compilers collections: [Erelen][6], [Dreame][7], [ms.Galileo-app][8], [Custom-maps-sourse][9] and some others. And as there are many maps from the program [SAS.Planet][10]. A total of about a hundred cards included. Here are some of them:

- Maps for city (Google, Here, Bing, Yandex, 2gis)
- Satellites (Google, ERSI, Here, Mapbox, Yandex) 
- OSM-based maps (Mapnik, Cyclemap, Outdoors, OpenTopoMaps, OpenSeaMap, OpenSnowMap)
- Digitized raster topomaps (Soviet military maps, GGC, Hiking maps with local coverage)
- Information maps (Wikimapia)

### How to install maps from the computer?
* Follow the links on this page and download any map.
* If you'll get zip-archieve, then extract files from it. 
* Copy dowloaded file to this folder on your smartphone: `\alpinequest\datastore\custom-maps\`.
* Restart the app to see the maps you've added.

That's all. If you have any suggestions what other sources of maps should be added to the collection (and what to remove), then send me an e-mail. It is desirable to attach a link to the page with the map of interest to the letter. And, of course, report bugs and inaccuracies on the site.
